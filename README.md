# 🎨 Pastel Modern Calculator

A clean, aesthetic, and functional calculator app built using **Flutter**. This project uses a unique purple-toned color palette and a modern flat design to provide a pleasant user experience.

## 🌈 Color Palette

This project uses a custom-coded color scheme directly in the Dart file:

* **Background:** `Color.fromARGB(255, 188, 152, 203)` (Soft Lavender)
* **Buttons:** `Color.fromARGB(255, 226, 194, 221)` (Pastel Pink)
* **Operators:** `Color.fromARGB(255, 110, 78, 186)` (Deep Purple)
* **Equals:** `Color.fromARGB(255, 81, 197, 85)` (Green)
* **Clear:** `Color.fromARGB(255, 245, 70, 70)` (Red)
